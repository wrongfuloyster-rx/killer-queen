###System Overview
####Introduction
####MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT)
Andy Stanford-Clark (IBM) and Arlen Nipper (Cirrus Link, then Eurotech) authored the first version of the protocol in 1999. It was used to monitor an oil pipeline through the desert. The goal was to have a protocol that is bandwidth-efficient, lightweight and uses little battery power, because the devices were connected via satellite link which, at that time, was extremely expensive.
